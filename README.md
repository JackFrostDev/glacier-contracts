# Glacier Protocol

This project is the home of development for the Glacier Protocol.

Glacier is a fully automated & self-sufficient liquid staking protocol, offering up to 9-11% APY on users' staked AVAX.

Glacier is a pooled staking solution that gives users exposure to the AVAX Validator network, without the hassle of setting up and managing the systems required to do so. It also doesn't require users to lock their tokens, or have significant upfront capital - meaning they can jump straight in to start earning daily rewards!
